## task
Create a single page application where the user will see the world map with markers on it.
Markers data(longitude and latitude )should be stored in the database and loaded from the
backend. Markers that are displayed on the page should appear there for a moment and
disappear after 3 seconds. Data should be sent to the frontend when itâ€™s created in the
database. Frontend should not make requests to the backend, WebSockets may be used for
sending data to the frontend.
